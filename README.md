============

**Version:** 0.0.2

**Description:** This is an ES6>ES5 Web Component for displaying local weather
based on geolocation. The geolocation is done through Google Maps API and the
weather forecast currently comes from [Open Weather Map API][1], it also
utilises [Weather Icons][2]. This project is based on my Angular 1.4 Directive project, click here for details:

production use.
